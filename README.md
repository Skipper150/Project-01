Partially integrated a combat system with variables measuring ammo, damage, and health based on what the player chose. There is also a pickup item that heals the player.

The combat system is unfinished with only a testing area meant for testing out the various variable changes.

A loop was planned either as a mission timer or a rudimentary enemy but the combat system took to long to figure out than expected
